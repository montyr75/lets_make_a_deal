In the game show, Monty Hall asked a contestant to choose one of three doors, after which one of the doors that did not conceal the grand prize would be revealed. The contestant would then be asked if they'd like to stick with the original guess or switch to the remaining closed door. This program will prove that to maximize the chance of success, switching is the right choice.
